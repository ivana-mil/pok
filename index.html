            <p >For formal experience in my field of education, I had only Basic Court Bijeljina as a probationer (volunteer) from August of 2014 to August of 2016.

After that, I worked in Ethno Village Stanišići, in Bijeljina, as a receptionist from March 2019 to August 2021 (and periodically now).
